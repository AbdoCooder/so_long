# so_long 🎮

## Overview 📚
**so_long** is a 2D game development project that involves creating a simple game using graphical libraries. This project, part of the **42cursus**, helps in understanding game development, graphical rendering, and event handling. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of graphics programming, game logic, and user interaction.

## Key Skills and Concepts Learned 🛠️

### Graphics Programming 🖼️
- **MiniLibX Library**: Learned to use the MiniLibX library to create windows, render images, and handle graphical operations.
- **Rendering Techniques**: Implemented techniques to render game elements such as characters, enemies, and collectibles on the screen.

### Game Development 🎮
- **Game Logic**: Designed and implemented the core game mechanics, including player movement, collision detection, and game state management.
- **Event Handling**: Managed user inputs and events, such as keyboard presses and window interactions, to control the game flow.

### Data Structures and Algorithms 📊
- **Map Parsing**: Developed algorithms to parse and validate the game map, ensuring the correct placement of game elements.
- **Pathfinding**: Implemented basic pathfinding techniques to manage enemy movement and player interaction.

### Code Organization and Best Practices 📏
- **Modular Code**: Organized code into separate modules for better readability and maintainability. Used helper functions to break down complex operations.
- **Norm Compliance**: Adhered to the 42 school's Norm, a set of coding standards that enforce good coding practices, ensuring consistency and readability across the project.

## Project Highlights 🌟

### Game Implementation 📜
- **Player Movement**: Implemented smooth player movement and interaction with the game environment.
- **Collectibles and Enemies**: Added collectibles for the player to gather and enemies to avoid, enhancing game dynamics.
- **Win and Lose Conditions**: Defined conditions for winning and losing the game, providing clear objectives and challenges.

### Graphical Elements 🖼️
- **Sprite Management**: Managed sprites for different game elements, ensuring efficient rendering and updating.
- **Animations**: Implemented basic animations to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the game.

### Event Handling 🔄
- **Keyboard Input**: Managed keyboard input to control player actions and navigate the game.
- **Window Events**: Handled window events such as resizing and closing, ensuring a robust user experience.

## Bonus Features 🎁
- **Advanced Graphics**: Enhanced graphical elements with additional effects and animations, improving the overall visual experience.
- **Sound Integration**: Added sound effects and background music to create an immersive game environment.

## Conclusion 🏁
Completing the **so_long** project was a significant milestone in my game development journey. It provided me with a solid foundation in graphics programming, game logic, and user interaction. The skills and knowledge gained through this project have prepared me to tackle more complex game development challenges and contribute effectively to any development team.
